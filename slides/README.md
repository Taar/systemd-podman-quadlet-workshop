# Information about the slides

The raw markdown data is stored within my personal Obsidian vault.
The files within this directory, save for this `README.md` files, were
generated using the [Obsidian - Advanced Slide Plugin](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/).

The `./css/my-dracula.css` theme was copied from the
[reveal.js repository](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/122642fdea04615a2d50f3d66c8ddca96816c396/dist/theme/dracula.css)
and modified slightly.
